### To install:

  1. Download the code, e.g. `git clone git@github.com:omgmog/chrome-imdb-add-to-trello.git`
  2. Navigate chrome to `chrome://extensions`
  3. Check the `Developer mode` toggle
  4. Click on `Load Unpacked Extension...`

You will need to generate an API key on Trello to use this, you can get one here: [https://trello.com/1/appKey/generate](https://trello.com/1/appKey/generate)


This is based on my other extension "[Add link to Trello](https://github.com/omgmog/chrome-add-link-to-trello)", which can be used to more generally add any page as a card on Trello.
